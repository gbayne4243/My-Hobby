<h1>My Favorite Thing to Do is Relax</h1>

<h2>I Like Watching Youtube Videos</h2>

<p>I like to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> Videos because there are very entertaining to me.  
There are a lot of youtubers out there and I can’t watch them all so I only really watch a few of them.  
My favorite youtuber is JeromeASF and he’s so funny.  
He makes videos about Minecraft, a game called Shell Shock Live, and he also makes videos of him and his friends.  
His best friends are Tewtiy, Alex or Dondo, Ben, Mitch or Bajan Canadian, and Ryan.  They also all have channels that I watch every now and then.  
He has over 4.2 million subscribers.  He even has a bunny called Cookie.  </p>

<p>Since he has over 4.2 million subscribers on his original channel he created three more channels called Jerome, JeromeACE, and a channel called BabyBacca.  
On his channel JeromeACE he makes videos about Shell Shock Live which is another game he does live streams for and GTA 5.  
On his channel Jerome he makes videos of challenges and real life videos of him and his friends.  On his last channel BabyBacca it is all about minecraft 
roleplaying and he enjoys that a lot too.  My favorite thing that’s happening right now is that there creating a new secret channel that they have yet to release 
the name of so I’m really excited about that.</p>

<p>His original channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JeromeASF">JeromeASF</a> is the one where posts the most content seeing as that is the most popular 
of all of his channels.  On this channel he plays minecraft.  He play all types of different minecraft games like pixelmon, races, battles, a lot of things he created
 on his own with the help of his friends and one thing he loves to do the most is stream minecraft game play because he enjoys playing longer and hearing from his fans at that 
moment so he can do what they want on the stream.  He usually plays with his friends witch I think to be funnier and more enjoying but sometimes he can't but the 
videos are usually still great.</p>

<h2>I also Love to Sleep</h2>

<p>Sleeping is amazing because you need sleep and it feels great because when you wake up you feel great.  So it's technically a win win.  
Some other reasons it's great is the fact that it reliefs your stress, refuels you, and usually it's peaceful due to the wonderful dreams unless you had a nightmare.
